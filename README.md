* Multiprocessed raw text content extraction from HTML pages.
* Multiprocessed scraping from HTML pages using a comfy JSON DSL.
* Data collection from various APIs such as [CrowdTangle](https://www.crowdtangle.com/).

## Installation

`minet` can be installed using pip:

```

## fetch

## extract

If you want to be able to use the `extract` command, you will need to install the [`dragnet`](https://github.com/dragnet-org/dragnet) library. Because it is a bit cumbersome to install, it's not included in `minet`'s dependencies yet.

Just run the following & in the same order (`dragnet` needs to have specific deps installed before its setup compilations can be run):

```
pip install lxml numpy Cython
pip install dragnet
```
